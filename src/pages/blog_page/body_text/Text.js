Cheers to me! Although I do sometimes think of how nice a glass of wine or a well-mixed cocktail would be, I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m punishing myself by depriving my body of some &ldquo;fun.&rdquo; In fact, the more I abstain from drinking, the more I appreciate my identity as a non-drinker.</p>
            <p id="46d5" class="ia ib dm ic b eg id ie if ej ig ih ii ij ik eo il im in er io ip iq eu ir is de ee" data-selectable-paragraph="">Perhaps being affected by alcoholism in my immediate environment for much of my life is a factor in my decision to stop drinking, but I mainly was compelled to do so because my body was not feeling great, all the time. After a while of doing sporadic alcohol fasts &mdash; a few weeks here and there, maybe a month if I was feeling spicy &mdash; I decided to just cut it out altogether.</p>
            <p id="8e73" class="ia ib dm ic b eg id ie if ej ig ih ii ij ik eo il im in er io ip iq eu ir is de ee" data-selectable-paragraph="">This isn&rsquo;t an article to throw shade at people who do drink, you do you boo. I simply want to reflect on and share 10 ways not drinking alcohol has benefitted me, so here it is:</p>
            <h2 id="1c78" class="jd je dm cc jf jg jh ie ji jj ih jk jl eo jm jn er jo jp eu jq ee" data-selectable-paragraph="">1. Drinking looks more unattractive to me every day.</h2>
            <p id="7dc6" class="ia ib dm ic b eg jr ie if ej js ih ii ij jt eo il im ju er io ip jv eu ir is de ee" data-selectable-paragraph="">Drinking was and has always been an escape from the immediate reality of my life, which means that I wasn&rsquo;t really enjoying my life if I was so keen to escape from it. Now that I am not regularly imbibing, watching other people do it is so not appealing. Losing inhibition so that you can blame your slip of the tongue or outlandish behavior on not remembering is&hellip;not my vibe.</p>
            <h2 id="de3b" class="jd je dm cc jf jg jh ie ji jj ih jk jl eo jm jn er jo jp eu jq ee" data-selectable-paragraph="">2. I am saving a lot of money without even trying.</h2>
            <p id="0ff1" class="ia ib dm ic b eg jr ie if ej js ih ii ij jt eo il im ju er io ip jv eu ir is de ee" data-selectable-paragraph="">I can&rsquo;t even imagine how my budget would look if bars were actually open right now, especially now that I live in LA where it seems to cost money just to breathe out here. All the money I am saving is now reproducing via stocks.</p>
